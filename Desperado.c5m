descr				"In the sun-scorched tales of the frontier, there echoes a legend that sends shivers down the spines of both outlaws and lawmen alike – the mythic gunslinger known only as "Six-Fingered" Dirk. His notoriety stems not only from the extra digit adorning his skilled hand but also from the mysterious pistol he wields, a weapon that spits explosive fury with each pull of the trigger. Legend has it that Dirk's pistol, named "Boomshard," was forged in the crucible of a long-forgotten blacksmith with a love for nitroglycerin. The bullets it fires carry the wrath of thunderstorms, detonating upon impact with a ferocity that can turn the tide of any showdown. Yet, it's Dirk's unparalleled skill in fanning the hammer that truly distinguishes him from the rest – a relentless storm of explosive bullets that can reduce a town to silence in moments."

Stories of this enigmatic figure paint a surreal picture: a man with a body so slight and unassuming that many ponder whether he's the man or the hat he's named after. But it's the hat itself that truly captures the imagination. A massive, ornate monstrosity of stitched leather, decorated with bizarre charms and symbols. It defies gravity, perched atop Tomothy's minuscule head with an inexplicable, supernatural force. Some whisper that the hat possesses a consciousness of its own, guiding Tomothy's deadly accuracy and granting him preternatural reflexes. Few have seen Tomothy without his iconic hat, and even fewer have lived to tell the tale. Is he the man, the hat, or a symbiotic fusion of both?"

Armed with a holy pistol sanctified by the tears of angels, the weapon carries with it a consecrated purpose, dealing righteous retribution to the sinful that dare cross her path. However, it's not just the firearm that defines her; it's the tattered Bible she clutches, adorned with a bullet hole that tells a tale of salvation.

classdescr          "In the untamed wilds of the west, the Desperado had already become a legend of myth. Deciding he needed more adventure, he sought out the lost city of gold, El Dorado. While he never commented on finding it, he did say he found a map, one that led him to a new frontier, Elysium. Not long after he arrived, others managed to follow him and many pioneers began to flow into Elysium in search of fame and fortune. Now, Elysium is just as much their home as anyone else's as the Desperado continues to try and make a name for himself. ^^ Those that followed the Desperado seek to build up towns similar to the ones they came from, centering around rowdy Saloons and filled with everything a town could need ranging from a general store to a blacksmith. As their presence gets bigger in Elysium, the government will become interested in exploiting the land for all its worth, sending more support and weaponry as time progresses, even the most advanced tech they've got. ^^ The cowboys and gunslingers that followed the Desperado may lack in constitution and brains, but make up for it in raw firepower. Miners seeking gold can be a helpful frontline when taking the riches of the land. As time progresses, the government will lend some nastier firepower and perhaps the Desperado may even convince some other legends to join him in Elysium." 
classabdescr          "Build up a town around a saloon with eight possible buildings each giving a different boost. ^ Units excel at range and can deal heavy damage, but quickly get overwhelmed in melee combat and have little natural defense against magic. ^ Can summon legendary units from real history, real myths, as well as new local legends from Elysium. ^ Able to eventually lay down railroads and get a heavily armored train to patrol the land."
